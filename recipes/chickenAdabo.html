        <h3>Description:</h3> 
            <p>This Filipino Adobo is an easy, savory chicken dish that has become a staple in my home. As it simmers, your kitchen fills with a sweet and sour aroma that will leave you excited to eat. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>White Vinegar</li>
                <li>Onion and Garlic</li>
                <li>Peppercorns</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Bay Leaves </li>
                <li>Green Onion</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned ~ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</li>
